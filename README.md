# UrlLocker

URL Locker lets you protect any existing link with a password. It works by encrypting and decrypting the URL so that access is only granted to those who know the correct password.

#### To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
